## Introduction 

There are two types of emergency contraceptive pill prescribed by pharmacies.

>* **Levonogestrel** (brand name: *Levonelle*) taken within three days of unprotected sex
>* **Ulipristal Acetate** (brand name: *ellaOne*) taken within five days of unprotected sex  


This report explores 

1) Prescribing patterns of emergency contraceptive pill (ECP) between 2019 to 2023. 

2) How ECP and antibiotics for STI prescriptions differ in geography comparing university town to a non-university town 

3) Compare patterns in ECP and STI antibiotics prescribing during Covid-19 lockdowns - did the need for ECP or incidence of STI antibiotics prescription go down during lockdowns?

4) How does SIMD relate to prescription of ECP / antibiotics for STIs

I have chosen to look at all prescriptions from 2020 and 2023. To do this I downloaded the prescriptions data for each month from: https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/prescriptions-in-the-community  

I wanted to explore how many ECP and antibiotics for STIs were prescibed during across 2023.

# Read in the Health Board names (HB_names). See code for link
HB_names <- read_csv("https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/9f942fdb-e59e-44f5-b534-d6e17229cc7b/resource/652ff726-e676-4a20-abda-435b98dd7bdc/download/hb14_hb19.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() # ensures column names are unique, lower case and replaces spaces and special characters with underscores. I will use this function for all read ins to ensure my data is consistent and easy to manipulate.

Define a function to read in the prescription data for a defined year:
```{r}
# #For efficiency I created a function to read in my prescriptions datasets.
# #I downloaded 12 months of prescription data for each year from 2019 to 2022. I placed the 12 months of data into their relevant folder named all_months_year, where year was specific to the data it contained.
# read_all_prescriptions <- function(year){
#   all_files <- list.files(here("data", paste0("all_months_", year)), pattern = "csv") #list.files() retrieves files from the relevant directory, and the paste0() dynamically constructs the folder name based on the year variable placed into the function.
#   all_prescriptions <- all_files %>%
#     map_dfr(~read_csv(here("data", paste0("all_months_", year),.))) %>% #map_dfr() row-binds the datasets being red in
#     clean_names() %>%
#     drop_na(bnf_item_description) # drop the rows with missing bnf_item values
#   return(all_prescriptions)
# }
```

Read in datasets using read_all_prescriptions() function and start tidying:
```{r}
# all_prescriptions_2019 <- read_all_prescriptions(2019)

Join and wrangle data:

## Key Results 

### What are the seasonal trends in prescribing of Emergency Contracpetion Pills in the years 2019 to 2022? 

This graph explores seasonal trends in prescribing of the two most commonly prescribed emergency contraceptive pills, Levonogestrel and Ulipristal Acetate, between 2019 to 2022 by Health Board. I plotted this to see if events such as Valentines day, University term start dates, or national holidays effect emergency contraceptive prescribing rates. I included 4 years of consecutive data to see if a one-time event, such as the Common Wealth Games caused any spikes in emergency contraception prescribing. Additionally by plotting the 4 consecutive years we can see if Covid-19 lockdowns in the years 2020 and 2021 affected emergency contraception prescribing rates.

Plot:
Population-Weighted Rates: Ensures that national trends are calculated based on the total population across all health boards, avoiding bias from smaller regions.
Accurate National-Level Insights: Better reflects overall prescribing behaviour at the national level, aligning with your goal to analyse seasonal and national events.
prescribing rates are weighted by the total population, providing an accurate reflection of overall prescribing behaviour across Scotland.

investigate what happened in 2019 - change in prescription practises over time ? 
did they used to use it for something else? 

Trends to note:

* Levonorgestrel is more commonly prescribed than Ulipristal Acetate. 
* 2019 and 2022 represent years without Covid-19 lockdown measures. 2019 and 2022 have a peak in prescriptions of Levonorgestrel in October and August respectively. This perhaps reflects increased sexual activity coupled with the return to university with 'fresher' week. 
* Between Febuary and May of 2020 the prescription rate of Levonorgestrel decreases. This is likely due to decreased sexual activity and risk taking behaviours due to the stringent national 'lockdown' measures introduced between X to Y in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
* At the start of 2021 prescription rate of Levonorgestrel is very low. Likely due to additional Covid-19 lockdowns.

It would be interesting to explore if different Health Boards prescribe different amounts of ECP.

### How does deprivation on the type of emergency contraceptive prescribed

How does deprivation influence type of contraception prescribed?
I wanted to explore if there was any correlation between the type of contraception being prescribed and deprivation. To do this I made a ratio of levonogestrel to total emergency contraception prescriptions. 

> A/(A+B)
> Where A = Levonogestrel (prescribed within 3 days of unprotected sex)
> B = Ulipristal Acetate (prescribed within 5 days of unprotected sex)

This is important to identify any variation in prescribing patterns in more deprived areas. Differences may suggest patients access health services later, so have to use Ulipristal Acetate, or that GPs or Pharmacists have differences in prescribing preferences in more deprived areas.

To measure deprivation I have used the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. I took the SIMD 2020v2 dataset from Public Health Scotland website [available from: https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/gl/dataset/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation/resource/acade396-8430-4b34-895a-b3e757fa346e ] as this dataset contains SIMD decile weighted per Health Board population.

When interpreting SIMD in deciles rank 1 is considered the most deprived, and rank 10 is least deprived.

## Conclusion 

### Recommendations from analysis 

### Limitations of the dataset and suggestions for future analysis

antibiotics are prescribed for pneumonia / other infections. Not specific to STIs. Maybe find what percentage of antibiotics for doxy / azithro are prescribed for STIs in scotland and use this as an assumption when completing further analysis?
