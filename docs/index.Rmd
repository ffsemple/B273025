# Introduction 

Preventing unintended pregnancy is critical for individual well-being and public health. Unprotected sex occurs for multiple, complex reasons including sexual assault, reproductive coercion, contraceptive mishaps, and lapses in contraceptive use @cleland_etal14 . Emergency contraception prevents pregnancy following unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. In Scotland emergency contraception is available as either a pill or intrauterine device. Oral contraceptives are the most used form, making up 90% of emergency contraceptive prescriptions@Emergency23. 

Pharmacies in Scotland dispense two types of emergency contraceptive pills (ECP):

>* **Levonorgestrel ** (brand name: *Levonelle*) - Effective within 72 hours (three days) of unprotected sex
>* **Ulipristal Acetate ** (brand name: *ellaOne*) - Effective within 120 hours (five days) of unprotected sex  

This analysis explores the factors influencing prescribing trends for ECP in Scotland from 2019 to 2022, using data from the Public Health Scotland Community Prescriptions Database. By investigating ECP patterns over time, geography and socioeconomic status, this report aims to identify disparities in access and inform strategies to improve public health outcomes. 

The analysis addresses the following questions: 

> 1) What are the trends in prescribing of ECP between 2019 and 2022? 
> 2) How does the ECP prescription rate vary by Health Board regions in Scotland?
> 3) Are pharmacies in more deprived areas prescribing more ECP than those in affluent areas?
> 4) Is there geographical variation in prescribing practices of ECP by Health Board region?

**Define a function** to read in the prescription data for a defined year:
```{r}
#For efficiency I created a function to read in the prescriptions datasets. I downloaded 12 months of prescription data for each year from 2019 to 2022. I placed the 12 months of data into their relevant folder named all_months_year, where year was specific to the data it contained.
read_all_prescriptions <- function(year){
  all_files <- list.files(here("data", paste0("all_months_", year)), pattern = "csv") #list.files() retrieves files from the relevant directory, and the paste0() dynamically constructs the folder name based on the year variable placed into the function.
  all_prescriptions <- all_files %>%
    map_dfr(~read_csv(here("data", paste0("all_months_", year),.))) %>% #map_dfr() row-binds the datasets being read in
    clean_names() %>%
    drop_na(bnf_item_description) # drop the rows with missing bnf_item values
  return(all_prescriptions)}
```

Read in datasets using **read_all_prescriptions()** function and start data wrangling:

Figure 1 explores if there is monthly variation in prescribing rate of ECP for the years 2019 to 2022. I included 4 years of consecutive data to see if a one-time event, such as the Covid-19 pandemic or the Common Wealth Games affects ECP prescribing rate. 

Due to low prescribing rates of ECP there is stochastic variation on graphical representation of the data. Interesting trends to note include:

* Levonorgestrel is more commonly prescribed than Ulipristal Acetate. Each month an average of 150 prescriptions of Levonorgestrel and 3 prescriptions of Ulipristal Acetate are dispensed per 100,000 women across Scotland. 

* The prescribing rate of Levonorgestrel has decreased each year between 2019 to 2022. This may be due to public health interventions to encourage use of long-acting reversible contraception, reducing the need for ECP. Alternatively this decrease may be due to difficulties in accessing ECP after the Covid-19 pandemic. 

* There is a significant decrease in the prescription rate of Ulipristal Acetate between 2019 and all consecutive years. This likely reflects the change in prescription guidance in 2020, where the European Medicines Agency recommended withdrawing Ulipristal Acetate as a treatment for uterine fibroids due to safety concerns. Prescriptions of Ulipristal Acetate from 2020 are specific for ECP.  

* In each year there are peaks in the Summer months suggesting there may be a 'Summer of Love'.

* Between February and May of 2020 the prescription rate of Levonorgestrel decreases greatly. This coincides with the Phase 1 Covid-19 lockdown. This suggests that the national 'lockdown' reduced opportunity to engage in unprotected sexual intercourse. 

## How does the ECP prescription rate vary by Health Board regions in Scotland? 

Wrangle data to get the columns and values of interest:

    hb_population = first(hb_population), # hb_population is consistent within each hb_name
    .groups = "drop") %>% # ungroup data
  drop_na(drug) %>% # remove rows with no drug values
  mutate(avg_annual_presc_100000 = avg_annual_total_quantity * 100000 / hb_population) %>% # average annual rate of prescriptions per 100,000

  group_by(hb_name) %>%

annual_avg_ECP_table
```

Table 1 shows that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and NHS Lothian have the highest annual ECP prescription rate. Interestingly these Health Board regions contain the major Scottish cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh. 

Generally the health boards with the highest annual ECP prescription rate also had the highest proportion of young people living in their health board region. This may suggest that young people aged 16 to 34 years are more likely to require emergency contraception.

NHS Ayrshire and Arran is an outlier to this trend having the third highest ECP prescription rate, and yet a relatively smaller proportion of young people living in this health board (19%). This needs further exploration, perhaps indicating that under 16s or over 35s are using the ECP services more in this region. 

More remote and rural Health Boards such as NHS Highland and NHS Borders had the lowest rate of ECP prescribing. They also had a smaller proportion of young people living in their health board.

When comparing the type of ECP prescribed table 1 shows that levonorgestrel is more commonly prescribed than Ulipristal Acetate. However this is not the case in the NHS Western Isles Health Board, where a similar proportion of Levonorgestrel is prescribed to Ulipristal Acetate. This perhaps highlights disparity in the prescribing practices by health board region. This is explored further in figure 3.

## Are pharmacies in more deprived areas prescribing more ECP than those in affluent areas?

```

Generally as SIMD decile increases the number of prescriptions of ECP decreases. GPs in SIMD1, the most deprived areas, prescribe the most ECP whilst increasing affluence is related to decreasing number of ECP prescribed. This suggests those in deprived areas are utilising ECP more, highlighting an inequality in health need. Perhaps this disparity is due to education, safe practices, environmental factors, access to long acting-reversible contraception. 

## Is there geographical variation in the prescribing practices of ECP by Health Board region?

I wanted to explore if there was any correlation between the type of contraception being prescribed and the location of the pharmacy. To do this I calculated the ratio of total levonorgestrel prescriptions to total emergency contraception prescriptions for each Health Board Region.

$$
\frac{Levonorgestrel}{Levonorgestrel + Ulipristal Acetate}
$$

A score close to one suggest the majority of prescriptions in this region are Levonorgestrel, whilst a score closer to zero indicates the majority of prescriptions are Ulipristal Acetate. This is a useful way of identifying variation in prescribing practices.

```

Health Board Regions in central Scotland predominantly prescribe Levonorgestrel. More remote and rural Health Board regions such as the NHS Western Isles appear to prescribe more Ulipristal Acetate. This difference in prescribing practice may highlight a disparity in ability to quickly access emergency contraception in remote and rural regions. Patients may present later to health services later, meaning prescribers dispense Ulipristal Acetate which has the longer time frame of 5 day. Alternatively this variation in prescribing practise may be due to differences in prescriber preferences in more remote areas.

# Conclusion 

Prescriptions of ECP are decreasing over the years. During 2020 there was a significant reduction in prescription of Levonorgestrel likely due to Covid-19 lockdown. When looking at Ulipristal Acetate a clear reduction from 2019 to 2020 onwards reflects change in prescribing guidance, no longer prescribed for uterine fibroids. 

Health Board regions with more young people and big cities had a higher rate of ECP precriptions. Ayr and Arran was a slight outlier to this pattern having a slightly reduced YP population and yet high prevelance of ECP prescription. Interesting to explore this further. 

More ECPs were perscribed with increasing deprivation. 

Geographicly - more remote pharmacies appeared to prescribe higher amounts of Ulipristal Acetate. Is this due to challenges in accessing pharmacy within 48 hours of unprotected sex, 

In conclusion prescribing patterns of ECP are determined by societal events, such as Covid or Summer, age, geography and deprivation.    

## Recommendations from analysis 
This report highlights that there are disparities in prescribing of emergency contraception across geography and social groups in Scotland. Further investigations into the reasons behind these trends is necessary to inform future sexual health policy making and reduce health inequality.

## Limitations of the dataset and suggestions for future analysis

This report assumes that Levonorgestrel and Ulipristal Acetate are dispensed purely for emergency contraception, and have no off-licence uses.

Differences in the volume of ECP prescribed in Health Boards may be due to patients living in one area but accessing ECP from another Health Board. 

Prescription dataset had 'dummy practice codes' for prescriptions which did not have a practice code. This excluded a large number of ECP prescriptions from the ECP-deprivation analysis as it was impossible to link them to a datazone and subsequent SIMD decile. 

With additional time it would be interesting to design a directed acyclic graphic to visually and mathematically model the probabilistic relationships between variables such as age, deprivation and geography influencing prescribing patterns in Scotland. It would be interesting to explore whether there are statistical relationships in the trends observed in this report.
