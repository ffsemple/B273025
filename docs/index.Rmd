# Introduction 

Preventing unintended pregnancy is critical for individual well-being and public health. Unprotected sex occurs for multiple, complex reasons including sexual assault, reproductive coercion, contraceptive mishaps, and lapses in contraceptive use @cleland_etal14 . Emergency contraception prevents pregnancy following unprotected sex or contraceptive failure. In Scotland emergency contraception is available as either a pill or intrauterine device. Oral contraceptives are the most commonly used, making up 90% of emergency contraceptive prescriptions@Emergency23. 

Pharmacies in Scotland dispense two types of emergency contraceptive pills (ECP):

>* **Levonorgestrel ** (brand name: *Levonelle*) - Effective within 72 hours (three days) of unprotected sex
>* **Ulipristal Acetate ** (brand name: *ellaOne*) - Effective within 120 hours (five days) of unprotected sex  

This analysis explores the factors influencing prescribing trends for ECP in Scotland from 2019 to 2022, using data from the Public Health Scotland Community Prescriptions Database. By investigating ECP patterns over time, geography and socioeconomic status, this report aims to identify disparities in access and inform strategies to improve public health outcomes. 

The analysis addresses the following questions: 

> 1) What are the trends in prescribing of ECP between 2019 and 2022? 
> 2) How does the ECP prescription rate vary by Health Board regions in Scotland?
> 3) Are pharmacies in more deprived areas prescribing more ECP than those in affluent areas?
> 4) Is there geographical variation in prescribing practices of ECP by Health Board region?

**Define a function** to read in the prescription data for a defined year:
```{r}
#For efficiency I created a function to read in the prescriptions datasets. I downloaded 12 months of prescription data for each year from 2019 to 2022. I placed the 12 months of data into their relevant folder named all_months_year, where year was specific to the data it contained.
read_all_prescriptions <- function(year){
  all_files <- list.files(here("data", paste0("all_months_", year)), pattern = "csv") #list.files() retrieves files from the relevant directory, and the paste0() dynamically constructs the folder name based on the year variable placed into the function.
  all_prescriptions <- all_files %>%
    map_dfr(~read_csv(here("data", paste0("all_months_", year),.))) %>% #map_dfr() row-binds the datasets being read in
    clean_names() %>%
    drop_na(bnf_item_description) # drop the rows with missing bnf_item values
  return(all_prescriptions)}
```

Read in datasets using **read_all_prescriptions()** function and start data wrangling:

Figure 1 explores the monthly variation in prescribing rate of ECP from 2019 to 2022. 4 consecutive years of data were analysed to investigate whether specific events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic or the Common Wealth Games influenced ECP prescribing rates. 

Interesting trends to note include:

* **Levonorgestrel is more commonly prescribed than Ulipristal Acetate.** Each month an average of 150 prescriptions of Levonorgestrel and 3 prescriptions of Ulipristal Acetate are dispensed per 100,000 women across Scotland. 

* **The prescribing rate of Levonorgestrel has decreased annually between 2019 and 2022.** This trend may reflect public health efforts to promote long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), thereby reducing the need for ECP. @Long Alternatively it could result from challenges in accessing ECP during the Covid-19 pandemic. 

* **A significnat reduction in Ulipristal Acetate prescriptions is observed from 2020 onwards.** Due to low prescribing rates of Ulipristal Acetate there is some stochastic variation however the downward trend in 2020 is clear. This likely correspounds to the European Medicines Agency's 2020 guidance recommending teh withdrawal of Ulipristal Acetate for the treatment for uterine fibroids due to safety concerns. From 2020, prescriptions of Ulipristal Acetate appear specific to ECP use only. @Ulipristal20   

* Seasonal peaks are obserevd in the summer months of all years. This suggests an increased demand for ECP during what could be described as a **'Summer of Love'**.

* **A marked decline in Levonorgestrel prescriptions ocurred between February and May of 2020.** This coincides with the Phase 1 Covid-19 lockdown, suggestring that national lockdown may have reduced opportunities for unprotected sexual intercourse. 

## How does the ECP prescription rate vary by Health Board regions in Scotland?

annual_avg_ECP_table
```

Table 1 presents the annual prescription rate of ECP per Health Board, alongside the proportion of young people living in each Health Board. 

Key points to note:

* **NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Lothian have the highest annual ECP prescription rate.** These regions encompass Scotland's largest cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, which may contribute to higher demand for ECP services.

* **Health boards with higher ECP prescription rates generally have a higher proportion of young people.** This suggests that young people aged 16 to 34 years are more likely to require emergency contraception, in keeping with current literature.@mehta_etal22 

* **NHS Ayrshire and Arran is an outlier.** Despite having the third highest ECP prescription rate, it has a relatively smaller population of young people (19%). This warrants further exploration, as it may indicate greater use of ECP services by under 16s or over 35s in this region helping to guide targeted interventions.  

* **Remote and rural Health Boards such as NHS Highland and NHS Borders had the lowest rate of ECP prescribing.** They also had a smaller proportion of young people living in their health board, which may explain this observation.

* **Levonorgestrel is more commonly prescribed than Ulipristal Acetate across most Health Boards.** However, in the NHS Western Isles Health Board the prescribing rates for Levonorgestrel and Ulipristal Acetate are nearly equal This variation may reflect disparities in prescribing practices between Health Boards. This is explored further in figure 3.

Generally as SIMD decile increases the number of ECP prescriptions decreases. GPs in SIMD1, the most deprived areas, prescribe the most ECP, whilst increasing affluence is associated with a decline in ECP prescriptions. This suggests that individuals from more deprived areas utilise ECP services more frequently, highlighting a potential inequality in health needs. 

This disparity may be due to factors such as education, awareness of safe sexual practices, environmental influences, or limited access to long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). Further investigation into these factors is essential to address this inequality. 

## Is there geographical variation in the prescribing practices of ECP by Health Board region?

This analysis explores if there was any correlation between the type of contraception prescribed and the location of the pharmacy. The ratio of total Levonorgestrel prescriptions to total emergency contraception prescriptions was calculated for each Health Board Region using the formula:

$$
\frac{Levonorgestrel}{Levonorgestrel + Ulipristal Acetate} = Ratio
$$

A score close to 1 indicates that the majority of prescriptions in this region are for Levonorgestrel, whilst a score closer to 0 suggests that the majority of prescriptions are Ulipristal Acetate. This approach provides a useful way of identifying variation in prescribing practices.

Health Board Regions in central Scotland predominantly prescribe Levonorgestrel, where as more remote and rural Health Board regions, such as the NHS Western Isles, prescribe higher proportions of Ulipristal Acetate. This difference in prescribing practices may reflect disparities in access to emergency contraception in remote and rural regions. Patients in these regions may present later to health services later, prompting prescribers to dispense Ulipristal Acetate due to its longer efficacy window. Alternatively, this variation could be attributed to differences in prescriber preferences or guidelines in more remote areas.

# Conclusion 

Prescriptions of emergency contraceptive pills (ECP) have decreased over the years 2019 to 2022. In 2020, there was a notable reduction in Levonorgestrel prescriptions, likely influenced by the Covid-19 lockdown. Ulipristal Acetate had a marked decline from 2019 onwards likely reflecting updated prescribing guidance, which discontinued its use in the treatment of uterine fibroids.

Health Board regions with larger populations of young people and major cities had higher rates of ECP prescriptions, whilst more remote regions with a smaller proportion of young people had a lower ECP prescription rate. 

ECP prescriptions were more prevalent in areas of greater deprivation.

Geographically, remote pharmacies appeared to prescribe higher proportions of Ulipristal Acetate. This may be due to challenges in accessing pharmacies within 48 hours of unprotected sex, necessitating the use of Ulipristal Acetate, which has a longer efficacy window.

In conclusion, ECP prescribing patterns are influenced by multiple factors including societal events such as the Covid-19 pandemic, age, deprivation, and geography.

## Recommendations from analysis 

This report highlights significant disparities in the prescribing of emergency contraception across different geographic regions and levels of deprivation in Scotland. Further research is needed to understand the underlying causes of these trends, considering if there are barriers to access or differences in prescriber practices. These insights will be crucial for informing future sexual health policies and interventions aimed at reducing health inequalities and ensuring equitable access to emergency contraception.

## Limitations of the dataset

* This report assumes that Levonorgestrel and Ulipristal Acetate are dispensed exclusively for emergency contraception, wihtout considering potential off-licence uses. 

* Differences in the volume of ECP prescribed across Health Boards may result from patients living in one Health Board region but obtaining their ECP from a pharmacy in another Health Board region. This may result in inaccuracies in attributing prescription rates to specific Health Boards.

* The prescription dataset included 'dummy practice codes' for prescriptions which lacked a specific practice code. This excluded a large number of ECP prescriptions from the ECP-deprivation analysis as it was impossible to link the prescriptions to a datazone and subsequent SIMD decile. This may impact the accuracy of the analysis.

## Suggestions for future analysis

* With additional time it would be interesting to design a Directed Acyclic Graphic to visually and mathematically model the probabilistic relationships between variables such as age, deprivation and geography on ECP prescribing patterns in Scotland. 

* It would be interesting to conduct statistical analysis to explore the trends in this report.
